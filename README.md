**Eye Tracker**

This project took knowledge CSS to generate two eyes from shapes that are able to dynamically track a mouse cursor independently.

**Improvements:** These eyes so no emotion! How can one evoke the intricate nuances of feeling if one can not express one's innermost complications? My eyes of course are like deep pools of emotion. Deep and cold, though sometimes warm. Quite hot even at times. Like a warm orange sun setting after a long day. One could read my inner most thoughts with a simple glance, though they may be overcome with empathetic emotion if they did.

**How to Use**
1. Download files.
2. Open index.html
3. Be freaked out.
